NAME
xemacs-packages.eclass - Eclass to support elisp packages distributed by XEmacs.
DESCRIPTION
This eclass supports ebuilds for packages distributed by XEmacs.
ECLASS VARIABLES
XEMACS_PKG_CAT (REQUIRED)
The package category that the package is in. Can be either standard, mule, or contrib.
XEMACS_EXPERIMENTAL
If set then the package is downloaded from the experimental packages repository, which is the staging area for packages upstream. Packages in the experimental repository are auto-generated from XEmacs VCS, so they may not be well-tested.
