NAME
edos2unix.eclass - convert files from DOS CRLF to UNIX LF line endings
FUNCTIONS
edos2unix <file> [more files ...]
A handy replacement for dos2unix, recode, fixdos, etc... This allows you to remove all of these text utilities from DEPEND variables because this is a script based solution. Just give it a list of files to convert and they will all be changed from the DOS CRLF format to the UNIX LF format.
