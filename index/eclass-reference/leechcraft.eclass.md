NAME
leechcraft.eclass - Common functions and setup utilities for the LeechCraft app
DESCRIPTION
The leechcraft eclass contains a common set of functions and steps needed to build LeechCraft core or its plugins.
Though this eclass seems to be small at the moment, it seems like a good idea to make all plugins inherit from it, since all plugins have mostly the same configuring/build process.

Thanks for original eclass to Andrian Nord <NightNord@niifaq.ru>.

Only EAPI >=6 is supported
